BIRB NEST INFO:
[!] In order to access the servers from a outside network, used ports (see config.json) needs to be forwarded. 
[!] Since the socket is running on a separate port, the peers need to know the socket port of other peers. Normally,
this would be integrated into yacy so that we can use the assigned port. This is a future work.
