BIRB NEST TODO:

[ ] Implement P2P messaging to birbs.communication.sender and .listener.
[ ] Remove the saving of a uploaded file to your drive (sil işte amk anladın). You just gonna read the value of the file.
[ ] Create a powershell script to run frontend-backend at the same time. ;)

BIRB NEST INFO:
[!] In order to access the servers from a outside network, used ports (see config.json) needs to be forwarded. For local testing
use the local ipv4 instead of public ipv4.
